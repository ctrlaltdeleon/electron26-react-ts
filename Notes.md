# My notes

- AI explains that for building distributions, it should be on the native machine or CICD, but don't have that luxury
- Finding a way to cache all the dependencies into the repo itself so that in the offline build we can reference that instead
- Ran into the issue for Wine again

# Tasks

- Try BRT Frontend
- Get the packages working for the boilerplate
- Get backend and mongo working
